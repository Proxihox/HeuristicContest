# HeuristicContest
Starter code repo for Inter-IIT Software Development Guild Selection for IITM.

## Instructions to use the starter code
1. Clone this repo or download the zip file, by clicking on the green colored "Code" button to the top right.
2. A sample main.cpp has been given which generates a dumb solution to the problem, and then checks its score by calling the ans_checker() function
3. The gettime() function has been left empty for you to code out
4. Modify main.cpp to generate a smarter solution
5. Back test your new code by running main.cpp
6. To streamline testing, write the input into input.txt and run the file using the below line :
./a.out < input.txt
This will automatically read inputs from the text file instead of the terminal
7. Submit main.cpp to the codeforces contest when you are confident with your solution. Multiple submissions are allowed
